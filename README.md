# Estimating Houseprices with RStanArm

This repo contains my slides and necessary code.

The results are based on data by Europace and were also published [here](https://tech.europace.de/hauspreise-in-berlin/) (in German).


For some visualizations, I use Shapefiles and some public ZIP code data which can be obtained [here (Shapefiles)](https://www.suche-postleitzahl.org/download_files/public/plz-gebiete.shp.zip) and [here (ZIP Code data)](https://www.berlin.de/senuvk/umwelt/luftqualitaet/umweltzone/download/umweltzone_plz_zuordnung.xls).
